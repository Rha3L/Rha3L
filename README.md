### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub account. I'm Rhae 😁

I’m currently working on frontend lanuages and frameworks including Javascript, Typescript, React and Nodejs (used to build simple server to learn frontend and backend communication).

Here are some fun projects I built in the past:

- [Pizzeria Hub](https://github.com/Rha3L/pizzeriahub-ts)
  A pizza shop website originally written in Javascript and React. I rewrited it in Typescript to practice Typescript + React.

- [SocialApp](https://github.com/Rha3L/socialapp-mern)
  A full stack social media app built on MERN stack. It implemented use authorisation, authentication and CRUD operations with database.

Status update:

🤖 I'm currently taking UC Berkley CS 61B course learning dynamic data structures, data types, storage management, principles of software engineering and some basic algorithms using Java.

🌱 Meanwhile I'm learning React testing using testing library and Jest via online resources.
