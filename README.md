### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm Rhae 😁

I’m currently working on frontend lanuages and frameworks including Javascript, Typescript, React and Nodejs.

Here are some fun projects I built in the past:

- [PizzaHub](https://github.com/Rha3L/pizzahub-ts)
  A pizza shop website originally written in Javascript and React. It implemented Redux Toolkit for state management. I rewrited it in Typescript to practice Typescript + React.

- [Dribbling](https://github.com/Rha3L/dribbling-mern)
  A full stack social media app built on MERN stack (MongoDB + ExpressJS + React + NodeJS). It implemented user authorisation and authentication via JWT. It practiced CRUD operations with MongoDB.

- [CS50 Projects](https://github.com/Rha3L/CS50-projects)
  Some interesting projects done in  CS50 course implemented using C or Python to practice algorithmatic thinking and effecient problem-solving.

Status update:

🌱 I'm currently studying C# .Net expanding full stack skills.
