### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. I'm Rhae 😁

I’m currently working on projects implemented by frontend lanuages and frameworks including Javascript, Typescript, React and backend framework of Nodejs.

Here are some fun projects I built in the past:

  A full stack social media app built on MERN stack (MongoDB + ExpressJS + React + NodeJS). It implemented user authorisation and authentication via JWT. It practiced CRUD operations with MongoDB and REST APIs.

- [CS50 Projects](https://github.com/Rha3L/CS50-projects)
  Some interesting projects done in  CS50 course implemented using C or Python to practice algorithmatic thinking and effecient problem-solving.
